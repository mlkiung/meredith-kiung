// // Get the auth API from Firebase.
// const auth = firebase.auth()

// // Ensure that we have (almost) always have a user ID, by creating
// // an anonymous user if nobody is signed in.
// auth.onAuthStateChanged(user => user || auth.signInAnonymously())

// // Further explanation:
// //
// // Whenever someone signs in or out (that's an "authStateChange"),
// // firebase calls our callback with the user. If nobody is signed in,
// // firebase calls us with null. Otherwise, we get a user object.
// //
// // This line of code thus keeps us logged in. If the user isn't signed
// // in, we sign them in anonymously. This is useful, because when the user
// // is signed in (even anonymously), they'll have a user id which you can
// // access with auth.currentUser.uid, and you can use that id to create
// // paths where you store their stuff. (Typically you'll put it somewhere
// // like /users/${currentUser.uid}).
// //
// // Note that the user will still be momentarily null, so your components
// // must be prepared to deal with that. This is unavoidableâ€”with Firebase,
// // the user will always be null for a moment when the app starts, before
// // the authentication information is fetched.
// //
// // If you don't want this behavior, just remove the line above.

// // Our root App component just renders a little frame with a nav
// // and whatever children the router gave us.
