			<pre>About Me</pre>
			<div>After spending several years learning and mastering how to grow small businesses, I sought a way to apply that knowledge to tech-driven enterprises. That’s why I enrolled in Grace Hopper Academy—an experience that intensified my passion for cultivating big new ideas and developing the solutions to implement them. I’m an outcomes-driven builder, doer, and collaborator currently seeking an opportunity to help your organization do something great.
